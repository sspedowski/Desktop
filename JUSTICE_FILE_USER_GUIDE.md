---

## üöÄ QUICK START GUIDE

### **Option 1: Update Main File (Most Common)**

1. Open `MASTER_JUSTICE_FILE_SUPREME.py` in any text editor
1. Add new document entries to the `master_data` list
1. Double-click the file or run: `python MASTER_JUSTICE_FILE_SUPREME.py`
1. Excel file updates automatically with all formatting

### **Option 2: Quick Add Single Document**

1. Run: `python JUSTICE_FILE_QUICK_UPDATE.py`
1. Follow interactive prompts to add document details
1. Merge pending documents when ready

### **Option 3: Bulk Import from Folder**

1. Run: `python JUSTICE_FILE_IMPORTER.py`
1. Point to folder with PDF/DOC files
1. Edit generated templates with document details
1. Merge templates to master file

### **Option 4: One-Click AI GUI (New)**

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. (Optional real AI) Set API key in PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
  $env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-5"
  ```
1. Run the control panel: `python JUSTICE_FILE_GUI.py`
1. Select evidence folder (must contain `.txt` / `.md` sources for now)
1. Choose tasks:

  - A = Summaries (per document structured output)
  - B = Contradictions Map (all docs)
  - C = Evidence Brief (integrated narrative)
1. (Optional) Toggle "Dry Run" to produce placeholder outputs without API cost
1. Click "Run Selected" or use "Run All (A,B,C)"
1. Monitor live log window; open Outputs / PDFs / Excel with buttons

Outputs:

* Raw markdown: `pipeline/outputs/`
* PDFs (non dry-run): `legal_export/pdf/`
* Excel enrichment: New rows in `AI_Outputs` sheet in `MASTER_JUSTICE_FILE_SUPREME_v1.xlsx`

Dry Run Behavior:

* Skips API calls
* Creates deterministic placeholder markdown
* Skips PDF conversion
* Still appends metadata rows into Excel (so you can test flow)
