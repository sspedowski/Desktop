---

## üöÄ QUICK START GUIDE

### **Option 1: Update Main File (Most Common)**
1. Open `MASTER_JUSTICE_FILE_SUPREME.py` in any text editor
2. Add new document entries to the `master_data` list
3. Double-click the file or run: `python MASTER_JUSTICE_FILE_SUPREME.py`
4. Excel file updates automatically with all formatting

### **Option 2: Quick Add Single Document**
1. Run: `python JUSTICE_FILE_QUICK_UPDATE.py`
2. Follow interactive prompts to add document details
3. Merge pending documents when ready

### **Option 3: Bulk Import from Folder**
1. Run: `python JUSTICE_FILE_IMPORTER.py`
2. Point to folder with PDF/DOC files
3. Edit generated templates with document details
4. Merge templates to master file

### **Option 4: One-Click AI GUI (New)**
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. (Optional real AI) Set API key in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
  $env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-5"
  ```
3. Run the control panel: `python JUSTICE_FILE_GUI.py`
4. Select evidence folder (must contain `.txt` / `.md` sources for now)
5. Choose tasks:
  * A = Summaries (per document structured output)
  * B = Contradictions Map (all docs)
  * C = Evidence Brief (integrated narrative)
6. (Optional) Toggle "Dry Run" to produce placeholder outputs without API cost
7. Click "Run Selected" or use "Run All (A,B,C)"
8. Monitor live log window; open Outputs / PDFs / Excel with buttons

Outputs:
* Raw markdown: `pipeline/outputs/`
* PDFs (non dry-run): `legal_export/pdf/`
* Excel enrichment: New rows in `AI_Outputs` sheet in `MASTER_JUSTICE_FILE_SUPREME_v1.xlsx`

Dry Run Behavior:
* Skips API calls
* Creates deterministic placeholder markdown
* Skips PDF conversion
* Still appends metadata rows into Excel (so you can test flow)
