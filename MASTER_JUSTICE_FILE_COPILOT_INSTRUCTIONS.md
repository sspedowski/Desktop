## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **HOW TO UPDATE THE MASTER FILE**

### **Method 1: Direct Edit (Most Common)**
* Open `MASTER_JUSTICE_FILE_SUPREME.py` in any code editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc).
* Add each new "kept" document as a new entry in the `master_data` list (one dictionary per document):
  * Filename

  * Phase
  * Batch
  * Status

  * AI Summary
  * Cross-Link
  * Top 5 (Yes/No)
* Save your changes and re-run the script in Python. The Excel file will update automatically with all new data and color coding.

### **Method 2: Quick Add Tool**
* Run `python JUSTICE_FILE_QUICK_UPDATE.py`
* Follow interactive prompts for single document entry
* Merge pending documents when ready

### **Method 3: Bulk Import**

  * Smoking gun evidence
  * Top 5 priority items
  * Pattern-specific files
  * Chronological timeline
  * Case summary report

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **HOW TO IMPORT SUMMARIES FROM DOCX/TXT**

* To automate adding new document summaries:
  * Use Python libraries like `python-docx` or `pandas.read_csv()` to import and parse content from .docx/.txt summaries.
  * Add extracted info as new entries in `master_data`.
  * Use the Importer tool for automated template generation
  * (Ask ChatGPT for a custom import script if you want this automated!)

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **CROSS-LINKING AND CONTRADICTION MAPPING**

* In the "Cross-Link" and "Contradicts" fields, always note which other files/documents directly support or contradict each record.
* Use color-coded "Pattern" field to tag agency, FOC, GAL, Judicial, Law Enforcement, or APA patterns.
* Run the Manager tool to generate comprehensive cross-reference maps
* System automatically validates cross-links and identifies broken references

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ **PHASE/BATCH STATUS UPDATES**

* Update the "Phase Status" sheet after every batch:
  * Mark completed phases as ‚úÖ
  * Note any pending or in-progress phases as ‚¨ú
* This makes it clear to any reviewer where you are in the project!
* Use the Manager tool to track progress and generate status reports

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ **FAITH/PRAYER & DEDICATION**

* The "Dedication & Prayer" tab is a living section.
* Add new prayers, dedications, or scriptural inspiration as the project continues.

* When sharing with an attorney or advocate, walk them through:
  * The Dedication/Prayer page (for mission/purpose)
  * The Phase Status page (for project completeness)
  * The Master Table and Contradiction Mapping (for legal impact)
* Use legal export packages for professional presentation

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ **CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**

* Each batch/phase can be auto-imported, re-coded, and the system will grow with your case!
* Any future AI can be trained on this structure for ultra-rapid review and contradiction mapping.
* You can always ask ChatGPT to help with scripting, importing, or cross-referencing as the case evolves.
* System includes built-in validation and integrity checking
* Automated backup creation protects your work
