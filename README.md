## üü¶ How To Use

### **Option 1: GUI (Fastest)**

1. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. (Optional) Set API key for real AI: PowerShell ‚Üí `$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."` and `$env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-5"`
3. Run: `python JUSTICE_FILE_GUI.py`
4. Pick evidence folder (containing `.txt` / `.md` source files)
5. Select Tasks (A,B,C) or press "Run All"
6. Watch live log. PDFs + Excel AI_Outputs sheet update automatically.
7. Use buttons to open outputs, PDFs, Excel.

Use the "Dry Run" checkbox to test without API calls (generates placeholder markdown).

### **Option 2: Command-Line Pipeline**

Run everything directly:

```powershell
python MASTER_PIPELINE_GPT5.py --input evidence --tasks A,B,C --children "Jace,Josh" --out pipeline/outputs
```

Dry run test (no API):

```powershell
python MASTER_PIPELINE_GPT5.py --input evidence --tasks A,B,C --dry-run
```

### **Option 3: Core Excel Refresh**

Use when only updating the Justice Master Table:

```powershell
python MASTER_JUSTICE_FILE_SUPREME.py
```

### **Option 4: Manual Script Workflow (Original)**

Still supported. Same behavior as before.

### **Quick Start (Legacy Manual Method):**

1. **Add new documents to `master_data` in the .py script**
2. **Run the script to regenerate the Excel file**
3. **Review, print, and submit as needed (for court, audit, oversight, or AI import)**

### **Advanced Tools:**

* **Quick Add:** Run `JUSTICE_FILE_QUICK_UPDATE.py` for interactive document addition
* **Bulk Import:** Run `JUSTICE_FILE_IMPORTER.py` to import entire folders
* **Validation:** Run `JUSTICE_FILE_MANAGER.py` to check integrity and export for legal teams
* **Always backup:** System creates automatic backups before major changes

### **For Legal Teams:**

* Use the auto-generated legal export packages
* Export smoking guns and Top 5 evidence separately
* Generate cross-reference maps for contradiction analysis
* Create timeline exports for court presentations

## üü® Mission Statement

*This system is dedicated to every innocent child, and especially to Jace and Josh. Let no injustice be hidden. Let every pattern be revealed. Let faith, hope, and courage lead us until every family is safe and every agency is accountable.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

Python 3.10+ recommended.

Install everything:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key packages:

* pandas / openpyxl (Excel)
* openai (LLM client)
* markdown, weasyprint, reportlab (PDF generation)
* pdfplumber, docx2txt (future extraction expansion)

### Environment Variables
Set before running real AI calls:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
$env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-5"   # or override in client if needed
```
If unset or using `--dry-run`, pipeline creates placeholders.

### Windows WeasyPrint Notes
If PDF export errors mention Cairo / Pango:
1. Install precompiled wheels (most modern Python distributions already bundle)
2. Or use fallback ReportLab output (plain) ‚Äî script auto-falls back
3. Ensure fonts installed (e.g., Arial) for consistent layout

### Dry Run Mode
Use GUI checkbox or `--dry-run` to:
* Skip API calls
* Produce deterministic placeholder markdown
* Still sync rows into `AI_Outputs` sheet
* Skip PDF conversion (by design)

### Output Locations
* Raw markdown: `pipeline/outputs/`
* PDFs: `legal_export/pdf/` (skipped in dry run)
* Excel metadata: `MASTER_JUSTICE_FILE_SUPREME_v1.xlsx` sheet `AI_Outputs`

### Adding New File Types Later
Extend `pipeline/utils/text_extract.py` with PDF/DOCX logic then allow `.pdf/.docx` in `list_documents()`.
